# Software Releases

This repository is used to publish public software releases. There is no source code other than the html and data files that are used to keep track of versions.

The repository publishes its files as a website via a GitHub action to https://quantelusa.github.io/Software/. Software applications can then check that website to get information about the latest releases by downloading the .ini file associated with the application.
